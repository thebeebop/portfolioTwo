              During the final year of my university studies, in the midst of a
              global pandemic, I had the opportunity to work on a project for
              the Salford Red Devils.
            </p>
            <h2 className="devil-section-titles">Meeting with the Client</h2>
            <p style={{ marginBottom: 50 }}>
              I met with chairman and managing director at the Salford Red
              Devils, Paul King and others from his team. This was done
              virtually via Zoom as social restrictions were still in place.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              They wanted some extra content to post on their socials to help
              support the revealing of their newly designed club logo. They were
              specifically looking for video content, so I proposed making a 2D
              animation.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>Although I had some experience in using After Effects, I
              had never before created an animation no longer than 5 seconds.
              Luckily, they did not know this and so gave me the okay to go
              ahead with the project.
            </p>

            <h2 className="devil-section-titles">Story Boards</h2>
            <p style={{ marginBottom: 50 }}>
              At this stage of the project I had a rough idea of how the
              animation was going to play out. I had a story board created and
              with the blessing of the Salford Devils team, I could begin
              working on the animation.

              The last minute trident idea
            </h2>
            <p style={{ marginBottom: 50 }}>
              During talks with the Salford Red Devils' team, there was an
              emphasis on the significance of the devil's trident. It was an
              important symbol to the club, so I was desperate to find a way to
              include it into the animation.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              After many rough sketches I finally found an idea that could work.
              The trident would be used as the foundation for which the club's
              new logo would be constructed on. This was also a nice visual
              metaphor of bridging the old traditons of the club with the newest
              of its conventions.

            <h2 className="devil-section-titles">Illustrations</h2>
            <p>
              Adobe Illustrator was an effective tool that I utilised many times
              during this project. I used it to help me deconsruct the club's
              logo, especially the devil's face, into seperate moveable parts.
              This was important as it could allow me to manipulate the
              individual parts as needed when using after effects.
            </p>

            <div className="main-image-two" id="devil-illustrator">

            <h2 className="devil-section-titles">Animations</h2>
            <p>
              After Effects was used for almost all of the heavy lifting on this
              project. I found it to be an incredibly powerful tool, providing
              me with a variety of different methods for tackling this project.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              The main animation sequences were developed in isolated
              compositions. I relied on my prior experience in the use of
              keyframes and the scale, position, rotation and opacity
              properties. However, regarding the special effects used such as
              the fire, wind and lightning effects, I utilised a 2D effects
              library which I dowloaded from the internet.

            <p style={{ marginBottom: 50 }}>
              As the animation sequences were created in seperate chunks, I used
              Premier Pro to stitch the sequences together to create one
              cohesive animation.

            <p style={{ marginBottom: 50 }}>
              The sound design was created using Premier Pro. Most of the sound
              effects were sourced from a free online sound effects library.
              Some of the sounds inlcuding those of the crowd chants were
              provided by the Salford Red Devils.

              Animating the devil's face proved to be a very technically tricky
